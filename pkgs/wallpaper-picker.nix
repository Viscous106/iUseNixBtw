# ── wallpaper-picker ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Wrapper for the Quickshell wallpaper selector whose QML lives at
# home/quickshell/wallpaper-picker/ and is symlinked live into
# ~/.config/quickshell/wallpaper-picker (see home/modules/wallpaper-picker.nix).
#
# The QML is deliberately NOT copied into the store: keeping it out-of-store
# means it can be edited and re-run without a rebuild, matching how rofi, qt6ct
# and hypr configs are handled in this repo.
#
# What the store DOES own is the dependency closure. Launched from a Hyprland
# keybind the process inherits Hyprland's PATH, which does not reliably carry
# quickshell/awww/mpvpaper/jq — hence the explicit wrapping.
#
# hyprctl, which apply.sh also calls (to pick a monitor for apply_video), is
# deliberately NOT in runtimeInputs: writeShellApplication's generated wrapper
# PREFIXES this closure onto PATH rather than replacing it, so hyprctl still
# resolves from the session PATH where Hyprland already put it. If it is ever
# unavailable there, apply_video falls back to mon="*".
