# Python library ecosystem migrated from Arch's explicitly-installed python-* packages.
#
# NOTE on coexistence: this file adds a THIRD python resolution path alongside
# whatever is already in home/user.nix (a bare `pkgs.python3` and `pyenv`).
# `pythonWithLibs` below is its own self-contained interpreter + site-packages
# closure, entirely separate from the bare `python3` package and from any
# pyenv-managed interpreter/venvs. Concretely:
#   - bare `pkgs.python3`            -> a vanilla interpreter, stdlib only
#   - `pyenv`                        -> lets the user build/switch arbitrary
#                                        CPython versions + virtualenvs at will
#   - `pythonWithLibs` (this file)   -> one fixed interpreter with ALL the
#                                        libraries below permanently baked in
# All three will independently appear on PATH as their own `python3`/`python`.
# Whoever wires the imports together should decide whether that's acceptable
# (e.g. "system python has everything" is genuinely convenient) or whether
# pyenv/bare-python3 should be trimmed down once this is in place. Not
# reconciled here on purpose, per the task split.
