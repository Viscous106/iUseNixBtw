# Accelerometer-driven screen rotation for this convertible Chromebook
# (Google "Ampton", Octopus / Gemini Lake).
#
# Rotation is deliberately gated on TABLET MODE — the accelerometer is only
# obeyed once the lid is folded past ~180° and the EC reports SW_TABLET_MODE.
# In normal laptop mode the panel never rotates no matter how far you lean the
# screen back. This is what ChromeOS does on this exact machine.
#
# Folding also mutes the built-in keyboard and touchpad, so palms on the back of
# the panel don't type. Unfolding restores everything.
#
# Subcommands:
#   init            session start: force the safe state, then correct it if we
#                   booted already folded
#   tablet on|off   called from the Hyprland switch binds in lua/laptops.lua
#   daemon          follow iio-sensor-proxy and apply rotation while folded
#
# Portable-safe: `daemon` exits immediately on a machine with no accelerometer,
# and `init` leaves a non-convertible in exactly the state it was already in.
